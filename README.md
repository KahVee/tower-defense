# Tower Defense
A simple 2D tower defense game with easily modifiable map files.

The objective of the player is to stop the approaching enemies from making their way into the last tile. The game itself 
is simplistic with shooting towers and resource-producing buildings.

A big focus of the project was to create a level file type that would be easy for humans to edit and customize. The .map 
file specifies the layout of the map, graphics used by each tile and enemy, the different statistics (speed, damage, etc.)
of all entities and more. Two example maps are found in /maps and the associated graphics in /pics.
